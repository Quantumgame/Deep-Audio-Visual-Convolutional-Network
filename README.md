# Deep Audio-Visual Convolutional Network

This is a Tensorflow implementation of our proposed deep audio-visual convolutional neural network for targeted advertisement in broadcast TV.
This model is used for commercial detection, categorization and replacement in broadcast videos, and can be trained either for a single task or in a multi-task learning fashion.
